NAME
    App::Nopaste::Service::PastebinComAPI - App::Nopaste service for
    www.pastebin.com using their API

CONFIGURATION
    To use this App::Nopaste service, you need to setup two environmental
    variables: APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_API_KEY and
    APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_USER_KEY

  "APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_API_KEY"
    The "APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_API_KEY" environmental variable needs to
    contain your pastebin.com API key. To obtain the key, create a free
    pastebin.com account, and then go on <http://pastebin.com/api> and the
    key will be shown in the 'Your Unique Developer API Key' section.

  "APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_USER_KEY"
    The "APP_NOPASTE_PASTEBINCOM_USER_KEY" environmental variable needs to
    contain your pastebin.com USER key. You can obtain a user key by running
    this piece of code, changing "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" to your pastebin.com
    API key, "YOUR_PASTEBIN_LOGIN_HERE" to your pastebin.com login, and
    "YOUR_PASTEBIN_PASSWORD_HERE" to your pastebin.com password:

        perl -MWWW::Pastebin::PastebinCom::API -wle "print WWW::Pastebin::PastebinCom::API->new( api_key =>  q|YOUR_API_KEY_HERE|)->get_user_key(qw/YOUR_PASTEBIN_LOGIN_HERE  YOUR_PASTEBIN_PASSWORD_HERE/);"

    Note: pastebin.com/api has this to say about the user key: "if an
    invalid api_user_key or no key is used, the paste will be created as a
    guest".
